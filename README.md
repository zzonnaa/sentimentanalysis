# sentimentanalysis
The project focuses on developing a restaurant review classification application that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize customer reviews as either positive or negative. The approach begins with data collection from a dataset of restaurant reviews, each labeled as "Liked" (positive) or "Not Liked" (negative). Various text preprocessing steps are implemented, including character and word count analysis, sentence tokenization, and the removal of stopwords (with particular attention to negations) to ensure meaningful analysis. A custom corpus is created by applying stemming techniques to normalize words. Subsequently, the processed text data is transformed into numerical features using the Count Vectorizer, which captures the frequency of words, allowing the model to interpret textual data.

To classify the reviews, multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers. The final model is serialized using joblib for deployment. A user-friendly graphical interface is built using Tkinter, enabling users to input their restaurant reviews and receive real-time classification results. The application effectively combines NLP and machine learning to provide insights into customer sentiment, enhancing decision-making for restaurant owners.
